# Drude (**Dru**pal **D**ocker **E**nvironment)
Docker and Docker Compose based environment for Drupal.

<a name="requirements"></a>
## Requirements

### Mac and Windows
Docker is not supported natively on Mac and requires a Docker Host VM - [Boot2docker Vagrant Box](https://github.com/blinkreaction/boot2docker-vagrant)

On Mac both [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-docker) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose) can be installed and used natively.

They are preinstalled and can be used inside the Docker Host VM.  This is also the only option available for Windows right now:

    vagrant ssh
    docker version
    docker-compose --version

### Linux
1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-docker)
2. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose)

<a name="setup"></a>
## Setup and usage

 1. Copy the contents of this repo into your new or existing project. Rename README.md to DRUDE.md if there is a name colision.
 2. Make sure your docroot is in `</path/to/project>/docroot`.
 3. Edit `settings.php` for the site (see [Drupal settings](#drupal-settings) below).
 4. cd `</path/to/project>` and continue with the steps below depending on your OS.

### Mac
If you have not installed Docker and Docker Compose - skip down to Windows instructions. Otherwise:

    vagrant up
    docker-compose up -d

### Windows

    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh
    cd </path/to/project>
    docker-compose up -d

### Linux

    docker-compose up -d

<a name="updates"></a>
## Updates
Base images will be updated from time to time. Docker Compose does not automatically pull new image versions.
To get an up-to-date version of the entire stack do:

    docker-compose pull
    docker-compose up -d

Configuration file updates ([`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) and [`.docker`](.docker) folder) have to be performed manually.
See the [commit history](commits/master) for recent changes.

## Drupal settings

<a name="db-settings"></a>
### DB connection settings

Containers do not have static IP addresses assigned.  DB connection settings can be obtained from the environment variables.

Below are sample settings for Drupal 7 and Drupal8.  
If you change the DB node name in `docker-compose.yml` (e.g. `mysql` instead of `db`) then this has to be updated, since variable names will change as well.

**Drupal 7**

```php
$databases = array (
  'default' => 
  array (
    'default' => 
    array (
      'database' => getenv('DB_1_ENV_MYSQL_DATABASE'),
      'username' => getenv('DB_1_ENV_MYSQL_USER'),
      'password' => getenv('DB_1_ENV_MYSQL_PASSWORD'),
      'host' => getenv('DB_1_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR'),
      'port' => '',
      'driver' => 'mysql',
      'prefix' => '',
    ),
  ),
);

```

**Drupal 8**

```php
$databases['default']['default'] = array (
  'database' => getenv('DB_1_ENV_MYSQL_DATABASE'),
  'username' => getenv('DB_1_ENV_MYSQL_USER'),
  'password' => getenv('DB_1_ENV_MYSQL_PASSWORD'),
  'prefix' => '',
  'host' => getenv('DB_1_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR'),
  'port' => '3306',
  'namespace' => 'Drupal\\Core\\Database\\Driver\\mysql',
  'driver' => 'mysql',
);
```

<a name="memcache"></a>
### Memcache settings

1. Uncomment the **memcached** service definition section in [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) to start using memcached.

2. Add the following lines to `settings.php` to point Drupal to the memcached node. Replace `</path/to/memcache-module>` with path to [memcache module](https://www.drupal.org/project/memcache) in your project. E.g. `sites/all/modules/contrib/memcache`

```php
// Memcache
$conf['cache_backends'][] = '</path/to/memcache-module>/memcache.inc';
$conf['cache_default_class'] = 'MemCacheDrupal';
$conf['cache_class_cache_form'] = 'DrupalDatabaseCache';
$conf['memcache_servers'] = array(
  'memcached:11211' => 'default',
);
```

<a name="file-permissions"></a>
### File permissions fix

With NFS mounts Drupal may complain about files directory not being writable. This is a "false-negative" however can be annoying and break certain things. For a workaround add the following to your setting.php file. 

**Drupal 7**

```php
# Workaround for permission issues with NFS shares in Vagrant
$conf['file_chmod_directory'] = 0777;
$conf['file_chmod_file'] = 0666;
```

You may also have to reset permissions on the existing files folder. The following command will recursively set folders to 777 (rwx) and files to 666 (rw)

```bash
chmod -R +rwX files
```

<a name="multiple-projects"></a>
## Working with multiple projects

Running multiple projects is very easy. 
Follow the [setup](#setup) instructions for each project making sure that ports used by containers accross all projects do not collide (e.g. two containers cannot use port 80 at the same time).

This requires a slight modification of the `docker-compose.yml`.
Edit the `ports` key for each container that does port mapping in `docker-compose.yml`.
You can either map unique ports for each container or use dedicated IPs:

**Unique ports**

```yml
ports:
  - "8080:80"
  - "8443:443"
```

**Dedicated IP**

```yml
ports:
  - "192.168.10.11:80:80"
  - "192.168.10.11:443:443"
```

For Mac and Windows see (boot2docker-vagrant/Vagrantfile)[https://github.com/blinkreaction/boot2docker-vagrant/blob/master/Vagrantfile] for instructions on enabling additional IPs for the Docker Host VM.

<a name="drush"></a>
## Runnig Drush

Drush is available inside the **web** container. To run it first open bash inside **web**:

    docker exec -it $(docker-compose ps -q web) bash

A more convenient way of running Drush is via the [docker-drush](.docker/bin/docker-drush) wrapper:

    .docker/bin/docker-drush st

To make the wrapper available in your shell directly (as `docker-drush`) add the following to your `~/.bash_profile`:

    # Docker custom project scripts
    export PATH="./.docker/bin:$PATH"

This will work universally on all projects using this repo.

<a name="wrapper-scripts"></a>
## Available wrapper scripts

 - [docker-bash](.docker/bin/docker-bash)- launches bash inside the web container
 - [docker-drush](.docker/bin/docker-drush) - launches drsuh inside the web container

<a name="php-mysql-conf"></a>
## Altering PHP and MySQL configuration

The following configuration files are mounted inside the respective containers and can be used to override the default settings:

- [.docker/etc/php5/php.ini](.docker/etc/php5/php.ini) - PHP settings overrides
- [.docker/etc/mysql/my.cnf](.docker/etc/mysql/my.cnf) - MySQL settings overrides

<a name="advanced"></a>
## Advanced use cases

- [DB sandbox mode](.docker/docs/db-sandbox.md)
- [Public access](.docker/docs/public-access.md)
