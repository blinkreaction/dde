# Drude (**Dru**pal **D**ocker **E**nvironment)

Docker and Docker Compose based environment for Drupal.

**For a fully working example of Drude setup take a look at:**
- [Drupal 7 sample project](https://github.com/blinkreaction/drude-d7-testing)
- [Drupal 8 sample project](https://github.com/blinkreaction/drude-d8-testing)


## System requirements

Please review [system requirements](/docs/system-requirements.md) before proceeding with the setup.

## Setup

1. [Drude environment setup](/docs/drude-env-setup.md)
    
    This is done **one time per host** and should be performed by everyone.

2. [Configure a project to use Drude](/docs/drude-project-setup.md)

    This is done **one time per project** and should be performed by the project TL.

## Updates

Switch to your `<projects>` folder and run:

```
dsh self-update
dsh update prerequisites
```

On Mac and Windows only (skip for Linux) also run:

```
dsh update boot2docker
```

## Drude Shell Helper (dsh)

Drude shell helper is a console tool that simplifies day-to-day work with Drude.
It provides a set of most commonly used commands and operations for controlling the Boot2docker VM, containers, running drush or other commands inside the **cli** container. (**Note**: dsh requires cli container to function properly)

See `dsh help` for a complete list.

`dsh` detects the environment it's launched in and will automatically start the boot2docker VM and launch containers as necessary.
It runs on Mac/Linux directly. On Windows `dsh` runs inside the Babun Shell.


<a name="cli"></a>
## Console tools (cli)

The **cli** container is meant to serve as a single console to access all necessary command line tools.
You can access **cli** container's console with `dsh`:

```
dsh bash
```

Tools available inside the **cli** container:

- php-cli, composer, drush[6,7,8], drupal console, phpcs, phpcbf
- ruby, bundler
- node, nvm, npm
- imagemagick
- python, git, mc, mysql-client and [more](https://github.com/blinkreaction/docker-drupal-cli)
